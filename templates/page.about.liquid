			<p class="desc">My mother passed away December 2014. It was the most devastating day of my life. While I was mourning, (and continue to mourn to this day), 
				I wanted to find a way to honor my mother and also have something for my future kids, 
				who will unfortunately not be able to meet her, to know the phenomenal woman she was. With my mother’s love of books, I came up with Snooks Angel Books, a customizable 
				family keepsake made with children in mind. Snooks is also my mother’s nickname her mother gave her when she was younger. This unique family biography will help preserve the 
				legacies of our lost loved ones and celebrate our past while shaping our future. Children will be able to learn about family who 
				have passed before they were born or help them deal with a current family tragedy while navigating grief.</p>
